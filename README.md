# Data Structures & Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental data structures, developed as part of the **CENG112 - Data Structures** course.

The implementations are based on the course curriculum and lecture slides, focusing on understanding the core logic behind memory management and algorithmic efficiency without relying on built-in libraries.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. Linear Data Structures
Custom implementations of core structures (both Array-based and Linked-List-based approaches):

* **Lists:** `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `LinkedListWithLastNode`
* **Stacks & Queues:** `ArrayStack`, `LinkedQueue`, `ArrayQueue`
* **Deques (Double Ended Queues):** `LinkedDeque`, `DequeInterface`
* **Bags:** `ArrayBag`, `LinkedBag`

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
* **Trees:** Implementation of tree-based structures (located in the `Tree/` directory).

### 3. Algorithmic Applications
Practical usage examples of data structures to solve classic algorithmic problems:

* **Expression Parsing:** `InfixToPrefix.java` (Using Stacks to convert mathematical expressions).
* **Syntax Validation:** `BalanceChecker.java` (Using Stacks to validate parenthesis balancing in code/text).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (Project structure included)
